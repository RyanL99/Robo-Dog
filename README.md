# Robo-Dog

This was my first project where I spent most of my time learning how servos, the Raspberry Pi 5, and a 3D printer work. I rebuilt the system multiple times to ensure everything functioned reliably. Since it was my first time coding a robot, I kept the software simple and focused on basic, dependable motion. 

This project was inspired by Fran Ferri’s Spot Micro.
